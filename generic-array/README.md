## Instructions
Add a method named ```GetItem``` which accepts an integer indicating the item index to be retrieved to the GenericArray class, to allow an element to be retrieved from the array.
Add tests.

### Desired Behaviour
When passing an integer to the new ```GetItem``` method, the element at that position in the private array is returned.
