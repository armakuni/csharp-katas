## Task 1
Add a method named ```GetItem``` which accepts an integer indicating the item index to be retrieved to the GenericArray class, to allow an element to be retrieved from the array.

### Desired Behaviour
When passing an integer to the new ```GetItem``` method, the element at that position in the private array is returned.

### Task 2
Add a method named ```Find``` which accepts an object, and returns the index of that object if it exists in the array.

### Desired Behaviour
When passing an object of type T to the new ```Find``` method, the index of the element if it exists in the array is returned, otherwise return -1.
