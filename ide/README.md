# The IDE kata

## Wait... this isn't a kata is it?

Well... no not exactly. But it is an opportunity to practice some important things.

When you rely on an IDE to make you productive day-to-day, it's important to know what it can and can't do for you. Below are some exercises, most of which you should be able to accomplish in your IDE of choice.

# Debugging

In this exercise you will debug a program which has been (poorly) designed so that it is hard to understand

1. Use the IDE to step through execution
1. Step into, and out of, procedures
1. Set a breakpoint
1. Set a conditional breakpoint
1. Inspect the state of the process at a breakpoint
1. Skip the execution of a line of code
1. Modify the content of a variable

Bonus: investigate multi-threading support

:heavy_check_mark: **Read the code comments which will tell you what to do at each stage**
# Performance testing / monitoring

# Refactoring
